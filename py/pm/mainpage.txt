     @subsection intro Introduction
     A pure <a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> package
     for running Rapid Scat Level Processing
	
     @section proc Procesing Status

     @subsection level Level Processing
     Level processing occurs in 5 steps:

     (0) Level 0
     
     (1) Level 1A
     
     (2) Level 1B
     
     (3) Level 2A
     
     (4) Level 2B
    
     
     The processing operation is nilpotent: step n is processed
     (processor.py) to step n+1 unless n=4, then it terminates
     (framework.py)

     @subsection auto Automation
     Processing is kicked off by the appearance of a science file.
     Processing a level 0 file leaves a level 1A file.

     Level 1a procesing requires additional data files.

     @section DI Dependencies
     
     C and V

     @subsection Fixed Fixed

     lipsu

     @subsection Variable
     
     sci.dat + int(task ID) --> logfile name, level00.rdf

     
     @subsection tests Testing

     test/test.py is a script that test the code (it is not profiled in this
     API doc).
