     @section intro The database
     The revs.py module provides a python interface to a single database,
     revs.DB, with a single sqlite3 table describing:

     Rev Number      Rev Start Time    Rev Stop Time      Processing State

     in the most pythonic (e.g., simple) way possible. The user does need
     to know anything about sqlite3, nor databases for that matter.

     Operator overloading takes care of everything. See the docsstring
     for details.\n

     You an create the database and put some sample revs in via...
